# Summary of our plan

One or multiple diseases will spread throughout a cityscape through both natural means
and infected people. A set number of "people" generated at the start -- as dots moving around --
as immune to the infection. A simple algorithm based on severity of the disease, predetermined
in settings, will have implications on the simulation; if the disease, or an aspect of it, is severe
people may move away from them for example. This will be relevant for the diseases mutation, which will happen at random
with preset attributes. When one person dies, the next two dots that touch will
produce a new person, that will take attributes from its parents. Gained immunity will not be passed to children.
The purpose of this simulation is to test two ideas: herd immunity, and evolution at an extremely basic level.
